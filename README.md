# Svelte.js + Flask Rest API
A small little CRUD to-do app. Flask is serving the front-end compiled Svelte files and there is a sqlite3 database attached to it. By using Axios in Svelte this API gets consumed and used. 

Svelte code needs some refactoring as everything is stuffed into App.svelte currently.
